    "* flood areas which to which warnings or alerts apply\n",

    "In this assignment we will be working with historical data of water level measurements, at several monitoring stations in Cambridge and on the Cam. The dataset is available as a CSV file at [https://teachingfiles.blob.core.windows.net/scicomp/flood.csv](https://teachingfiles.blob.core.windows.net/scicomp/flood.csv). If you go home over Christmas and are worried about flooding, and want to extend these analyses to your home area, see [A3. Data import and cleanup](A3.%20Data%20import%20and%20cleanup.ipynb) for details of how to fetch data from a web API.\n",
